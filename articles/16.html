The Discuss of Years, A Monument<br/>
	<br/>This is a song fan song written flowing a book called Three-Body Problem, which is science fiction. It talks a story about a Chinese observer discovered an alien civilization during the Cultural Revolution. She is called Ye, who was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. And this song shows her loneliness. She witnessed that her father died in a big denounce meeting, her friend betrays their promise, and she forced to admit her father is a sinner. She cannot talk about these with others; she is lonely, just like the Earth. Her despair makes her send the location of the earth to space so that some other civilization can come to help us. But this caused an invasion, so she also caught in a deep self-blame.
	<br/>There is much metaphor used in this song; most of them are on behalf of Ye. In the first line, “Evening primrose, covered with frost. Lonely bird, in the hustle and bustle.” (Translated), the evening primrose and the lonely bird are clear to mean Ye. Because of so much pressure, her heart is closed and isolated from outside. 
	<br/>Some other lines are “Never remembering, how to forget. … The wind crossed the hills again, but the dreams were already obsolete. … Storys also never been told.” (Translated). Ye leave the Alien Civilization Monitoring Station after the Cultural Revolution. Few people know the pass of Ye. Here the wind indicates Ye, when Ye go back to the station, she is old, no one can achieve that dream after. In the book, this is a “turning point” of erath history.
	<br/>This is a fan song, so it has so many things link to the book, and it has a profound theme, understanding, and interpretation.
