# Automated Hidden Camera Detector

## Project Description

This project is used for GeekPwn 2019 Anti Sneak Shot Challenge. This project is a device that makes it easy to find hidden cameras that may be in your room. It can finish most of the work by itself automatically. 

## Project Principle Introduction

Base on research, we find out that we can use the following methods to find hidden cameras:

- Most of the camera has a "clock" that can control the image sensor to shoot each pixels, and this will emit radio waves into the air. If we can pick up the radio wave and try to find out where it is from, we can find the hidden camera.
